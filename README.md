# Linux Australia Constitution

This holds the definitive copy of the Linux Australia Constitution.

All constitutional change swill be created on branches and then moved into
the master branch after they have been voted on. Each motion at the AGM or SGM should
be created as a single commit (Hint. Use rebase a lot!).

Every time changes are made to be submitted to Fair Trading a version should be
tagged.

The motions that go to the email list should be generated by using git log to
show the commit message and

    git diff -r reva..revb --word-diff=plain to show the differences
